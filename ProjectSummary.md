# Summary of Phase 1 : Frontend

## Day 1-3 : Research and Design Phase
- In the first three days, I did research on features for the PG Application. I looked at what the app needs, like user login and search tools. I decided the total components of the app, such as screens and buttons. Then, I designed rough images on a notebook to plan the layout. After that, I made the actual designs for every page using design tools.
- I learned about planning and design. It helped me see how the app will work and connect all parts. This phase was important for starting the project well.

## Day 4-10 : Building Actual Frontend Design
- From day 4 to 10, I focused on creating all the main screens for my PG Application in Flutter. I built the home page, listing page, view details page, profile page, login page, and signup page. I also read the guideline PDF, which gave me good ideas, so I decided to add a favourite page and a reviews system to make the app more useful for users.
- I learned about some useful packages like flutter_form_builder for making forms easier, validator package for checking inputs, carousel slider for showing images nicely, and a few more. These packages saved time and made coding simpler.

- The Challenge in my PG Application project was getting started with animations in Flutter. I didn't know much about them at first, which made it tricky to make the app feel smooth and fun. So, I jumped in by learning the basics through some easy YouTube tutorials, found a few helpful templates online, and just played around with them until things clicked. In the end, I created simple route animations for navigating between the login and register pages, which was a cool win and taught me how animations can make the user experience way better.
